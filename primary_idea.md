# Heatmap over forurening (+ eventuelt støj) i københavnsområdet  
- - - - -
**What to meassure**: CO2 and other air polution factors in central copenhagen, with the help of an R/C car, with an arduinoi with sensors and gps module onboard  
  
**How it helps**: By meassuring the air polution will be able to do 2 things:  
  1) notify authorities about troubled areas, so they can attempt to correct it.
  2) Develop an app that can notify people in risk groups (like ashtma) about the hightened polution

# data collection facilitating unit (DCFU)
A drone with a flight clearance (issued by KPD) of 3-4 meter, with a range of 300-500 meters from base could help greatly in facilitating data collection, and mapping out copenhagen  
the arduino could just be attached to set drone as a module  
If neccesarry a raspberry pi serving as "flight controller" can also be retro-fitted as to ensure the clearence is not voided.  
This topic will be discussed further the 10th of october
